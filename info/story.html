Nicola is taking a much needed vacation.  
He'll be backpacking around some lesser-known countries.  
Each has its own unique currency.

When making purchases, Nicola would like to use the minumum number of coins possible.  
For example, Outer Leftopia has coins with denomination 1, 3, and 5 shillings.  
He wants to buy a souvenir that costs 13 shillings.  He can do that using two 5 shilling coins and one 3 shilling coin.
